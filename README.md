Vigenere Cipher

Project : Vigenere Cipher Decryption
This project is related to Cipher and I have createdthe program "Vigenère cipher". Vigenere Cipher is a method encrypting alphabetic text. On a high level it consists of Plain text (to encrypt) and Key.  It’s a complex Polyalphabetic cipher technique. This technique is used to secure data in the form of digital images.

This program is writted in C++, by using Discreate structure concept of Cryptography, and it consists of following functions:
•	Encrypt – To perform encryption of the plaintext. 
•	Decrypt – To decrypt the encrypted string. 
•	GenerateKey – To generate the key to match the length of the plaintext. 
•	GetPlainText – This function gets user input for plaintext, validate it using Regular expression and return to main function.
•	GetKeyword This function gets the user input for Key, validate it using Regular expression and return to main function.
•	ConvertToUpper – This function is to convert the plaintext and key to upper case.

Instruction to use the program:
1. Run the program
2.  Program will prompt "Please enter the string to encrypt (Alphabets only)" enter Alphabets only ( it will automatically conver those to upper case)
3.  Then Program will prompt "Please enter the Key (Alphabets only)" here you will enter Key word.
4.  As soon as you enter program will show Encrypter/Decrypted values.
5.  Program will ask if you want to continue then press Y else any key to exit.
